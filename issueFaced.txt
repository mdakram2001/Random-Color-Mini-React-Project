The issue in your code is related to how you're handling the onClick events in your buttons. Let's go through the problems and how to fix them:

Incorrect Function Calls in onClick:
In your buttons' onClick handlers, you are currently directly invoking functions rather than passing function references. This causes those functions (setType('hex'), setType('rgb'), generateRandomColor(type)) to be called immediately when the component renders, leading to a continuous loop of state updates and re-renders.

Proper Handling of onClick:
The onClick prop in React expects a function that will be called when the button is clicked. You should pass a function reference (() => ...) rather than calling the function directly.
